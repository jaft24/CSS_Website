Prior to Concordia College, I completed the IB program in Japan, where I was first introduced to the world of Computer Science. I love the idea of solving problems, designing, and creating ideas. When I'm not studying, I'm listening to music, on a call with family, singing, praising the Lord, or learning random things on YouTube. It will be a pleasure to serve you as the club's vice president. I believe collaboration is key; no one knows more than anyone else, and we can complete each other's ideas, growing together!"
